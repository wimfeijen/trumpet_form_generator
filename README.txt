Trumpet is a CMS of which the source code will be published on github.

Part of the Trumpet CMS is the form_generator (formerly known as autoform), which let's the admin add custom forms to his site.

If you need any hint on configuring the form_generator app to use it in your apps, please contact me (wim@go2people.nl). To credit the author: the form_generator is written by Rudolph Froger.
